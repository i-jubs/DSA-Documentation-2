This is where i started my portfolio while taking my data analysis class with Incubator Hub using my Power bi project.

## Project overview
This data analysis Project aims to analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmoria management team would need to address.

### Data Sources
The Primary data source here is Palmoria management dataset which was provided by Incubator Hub for this Project.

### Tools used
- Ms excel for data collection.
- Cv text for data collection.
- Power query for data transformation.
  - For data cleaning
     - Data manipulation
     - Data munching
- Power bi for visualization

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following were the focus of this analysis;
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000
 -  Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
 - Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, etc.?
 - Also visualize this by regions.
5. Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees
 - Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus)
 - Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide.
